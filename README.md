rmapcounties
-----------------------------------
map counties using leaflet
===================================

This R package provides some tools to make it easier to map US counties. Tools include:

  - `getcountymaps()` - downloads data from the US census necessary to build a leaflet map
  - `countieswithindrivingdistance()` - a function to find all counties within a particular driving distance from a location
  - `drivablecountesvsregion()` - a function to compare counties within driving distance to a preestablished region

These funtions are designed primarily in support of Millikin University's Alumni & Development Center and are licesensed under the GPLv3 or later.
